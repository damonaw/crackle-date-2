## Tasks
1. Audit existing panel components to list current styling and semantic gaps relative to the new menu.
2. Update Stats, Solutions, Achievements, and Tutorial panel markup/CSS to match the refreshed card style (rounded corners, gradients, spacing, typography).
3. Normalize navigation/back buttons and section headings to modern semantically-correct tags with consistent aria labels.
4. Verify focus states and scrolling behavior meet accessibility standards on small devices.
5. Run lint/style checks and conduct a quick manual QA pass across all panels.
