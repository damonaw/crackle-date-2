## Tasks
1. Document current back button markup/styles across panels and decide on common structure.
2. Implement a shared back-button class (or component pattern) with consistent icon, padding, and focus state; update Stats, Solutions, Achievements, and Tutorial headers to use it.
3. Verify small-screen spacing/alignment and ensure aria-labels + keyboard interactions remain correct.
4. Run lint/style checks and manually smoke-test each panel from the menu.
