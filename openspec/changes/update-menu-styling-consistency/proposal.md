# Update Menu Styling Consistency

## Problem Statement
The current menu uses a different visual style compared to the recently updated solutions, achievements, and stats panels. This creates visual inconsistency when users open the menu from the main game screen.

## Proposed Solution
Update the menu styling to match the established design patterns from solutions and achievements panels:

1. **Consistent Card-Based Layout**
   - Replace current sheet design with card-based layout
   - Apply same background colors, borders, and shadows
   - Use consistent border radius and spacing

2. **Matching Header Design**
   - Update menu header to match panel headers
   - Consistent typography and spacing
   - Same close button styling

3. **Unified Navigation Items**
   - Style menu navigation items to match panel content cards
   - Consistent hover effects and transitions
   - Same padding and visual hierarchy

4. **Visual Consistency**
   - Apply same CSS variables and color scheme
   - Matching card designs and hover effects
   - Consistent responsive breakpoints

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Menu styling matches solutions/achievements panels
- [ ] Header design is consistent with panel headers
- [ ] Navigation items have matching card styling
- [ ] Hover effects and transitions are consistent
- [ ] Responsive design matches other panels
- [ ] Menu functionality remains intact

## Technical Approach
- Update existing menu CSS classes to use panel styling patterns
- Apply consistent card-based layout for menu sections
- Ensure responsive design matches other panels
- Maintain all existing menu functionality while updating visual design

## Why
Visual consistency is crucial for user experience and professional application design. The menu is a primary navigation element that users interact with frequently, and its inconsistent styling creates a disjointed experience. By aligning the menu design with the established panel patterns, we create a cohesive interface that feels more polished and intentional.

## Impact Assessment
- **Users**: More consistent and professional UI experience
- **Development**: Easier maintenance with shared styling patterns
- **Design**: Unified visual language across all game interfaces
