## Tasks
1. Redesign the menu markup/CSS so it fits on 320px-width screens, separates navigation vs settings, and remains scrollable without overlapping content.
2. Add a persisted `showInputClicks` preference in the game store/localStorage, expose a toggle in the menu, and conditionally render the in-game indicator based on it.
3. Refresh dark theme tokens/variables to introduce the purple palette while maintaining readability (update global CSS + dependent components if needed).
4. Enhance light mode operator buttons with more color (background/border states) and ensure hover/active/focus states remain accessible.
5. Run lint/style checks and manually verify the menu, toggle, and themes on different breakpoints.
