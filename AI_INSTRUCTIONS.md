# CRACKLE-DATE AI INSTRUCTIONS

## CONTEXT
PROJECT: Daily math puzzle web game called "Crackle-Date"
DEVELOPER: Solo developer, 10+ years experience
TARGET: Daily puzzle enthusiasts (Wordle/crossword/Sudoku players)
GOAL: Create equations using today's date digits

## CORE GAME MECHANICS

### FUNDAMENTAL RULES
- Use ALL digits from today's date in EXACT order they appear
- Date format: M-DD-YYYY (US Eastern Time) - example: 9-17-2025
- Must place exactly ONE equals sign (=) to create valid equation
- Both sides must be mathematically equal
- Example: 9-17-2025 ‚Üí `9 * 1 + 7 * 2 + 0 = 2^5`

### ALLOWED OPERATIONS
BASIC: + - * /
ADVANCED: ^ (power), ‚àö (square root)
FUNCTIONS: |n| (absolute), n! (factorial), % (modulo)
GROUPING: () for precedence
FORBIDDEN: Logic operators (||, &&, !), bitwise operations

### SCORING RULES
- Complex solutions = higher points
- Simple solutions = lower points
- Trivial solutions = negative points (multiply by zero, identity like 1=1)
- Multiple submissions allowed

## MVP REQUIREMENTS (COMPLETED)
1. ‚úÖ Basic game interface with date display
2. ‚úÖ Equation input system (text-based with validation)
3. ‚úÖ Mathematical expression parser/validator (mathjs + custom validation)
4. ‚úÖ Basic scoring mechanism (complexity-based)
5. ‚úÖ Light/dark mode toggle
6. ‚úÖ Mobile-first responsive design
7. ‚úÖ Stats tracking and display

- Leaderboards
- Community galleries
- ‚úÖ Mathematical formatting display (KaTeX rendering implemented)
  - ‚úÖ Superscript exponents: 5^6 ‚Üí 5‚Å∂
  - ‚úÖ Proper fraction display: 1/2 ‚Üí fractions
  - ‚úÖ Square root symbols: sqrt(16) ‚Üí ‚àö16
  - ‚úÖ Absolute value bars: abs(x) ‚Üí |x|
  - ‚úÖ Math textbook format in Stats display
